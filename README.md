# Perception

Perception is an engine for my [homepage], a shameless attempt to benefit from both
Static Site Generators concept and typical Laravel setup. Nothing really advanced
in fact but feel free to take inspiration.

The code itself is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE.md). However, it **DOES NOT** apply
to the page content which is proprietary and copying it without my explicit permission
is strictly forbidden.
